Getty Images is my go-to resource for paid commercial images.

Commercial images mean they work well for all kinds of business.

#4 – Shutterstock.com & Bigstock.com
Paid – More affordable paid image resources for commercial applications in ads, business websites, brochures, etc
Shutterstock and Bigstock are two separate companies. The reason we’ve grouped them together is because they pretty much do the same job.

Both have very wide range of photos and graphics to choose from and neither are too expensive.

If you run a blog and need images on a regular basis, Bigstock has an affordable monthly plan that allows you to customize the number of images you can download each month.

Rawpixel is an excellent place to find beautiful and free images that is very usable for any business websites.

When you are building a business website you want to use images with context. An image with context is an images that tells a story, which creates a much stronger connection with your visitors and also communicates subtly what your business is all about.
